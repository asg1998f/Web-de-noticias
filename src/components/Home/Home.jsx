Nestled in the heart of Vigo, Spain, sits a humble yet majestic cornerstone of the city’s cultural history: *Alberto’s Library*. Established in 1923, this sanctuary of stories began as the dream of one man, Alberto Fernández, a quiet yet fiercely passionate bibliophile. Over a century later, Alberto’s Library remains a cherished haven for readers, dreamers, and scholars alike.

Alberto Fernández was born in 1879 in a small fishing village outside Vigo. The son of a fisherman, Alberto’s childhood was far from books and classrooms. Yet, fate had its own plans. At the age of ten, while delivering fish to the bustling port of Vigo, he stumbled into a dilapidated bookstore run by an eccentric Englishman. Alberto was mesmerized by the rows of dusty, leather-bound tomes, their spines gilded with titles in languages he didn’t yet understand. The shopkeeper handed him an old, tattered copy of *Don Quixote* as a gift, and from that moment, Alberto's love for literature ignited.

Years passed, and Alberto worked tirelessly, saving every peseta he could while devouring every book that crossed his path. By 1923, he had accumulated a modest collection of rare manuscripts, poetry anthologies, and translations of Shakespearean plays. With these treasures in hand, he opened *Alberto’s Library* on a narrow cobblestone street near Vigo's port. Its location, tucked away from the bustling markets, gave it a serene, almost otherworldly quality.

The library was small, with just one room illuminated by large bay windows that let in Vigo’s moody Atlantic light. Wooden shelves lined every inch of the walls, filled with books arranged by genre and language. Alberto himself crafted the shelves, their rich oak polished to a gleaming finish. In the corner, a worn armchair sat beside a small table holding a brass lamp, inviting readers to linger and lose themselves in the pages of a good book.  

At first, Alberto’s Library served only a handful of loyal patrons: sailors seeking tales of far-off lands, students desperate for academic texts, and poets chasing inspiration. However, as word of the library spread, it became a hub for the intellectual and artistic community of Vigo. During the Spanish Civil War, *Alberto’s Library* became more than a refuge for readers—it was a place of quiet resistance. Alberto secretly hid banned books beneath the floorboards, ensuring that the voices of revolutionary thinkers survived the conflict.

After Alberto’s death in 1954, his daughter, Marisol, took over the library. She expanded its collection to include contemporary works and translations of American authors like Hemingway and Steinbeck. Under her stewardship, the library adapted to modern times without losing its charm. In 1987, it became the first library in Galicia to host a public poetry reading, an event that continues annually to this day.  

Now, nearly 101 years after its founding, *Alberto’s Library* remains a beloved landmark in Vigo. The armchair by the brass lamp still sits in the corner, often occupied by a young reader discovering their first great novel. The oak shelves, though worn with age, still carry the weight of stories that transport visitors to realms both real and imagined. In every way, *Alberto’s Library* is more than just a collection of books—it is a testament to the enduring power of literature, a bridge between past and present, and a beacon of light for the generations yet to come.
